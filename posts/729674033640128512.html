                    <p>Bloody, was watching a seminar about how boutique brands only started reducing excess nutrients and minerals in their products when they realized their business model won&rsquo;t survive climate change and more pet guardians are becoming more conscious of their carbon footprint.<br/><br/>And &hellip; I am just like &hellip; me and the previous partner had this conversation almost ten years ago about the environmental and ecological impacts of companion animals. <br/><br/>All the &ldquo;dogs are wolves and require high protein&rdquo; naysayers only started changing their minds and singing a different tune now that they can&rsquo;t deny reality of climate change?<br/><br/>Seriously?</p>
