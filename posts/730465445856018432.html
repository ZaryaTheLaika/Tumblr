But she&rsquo;s a medium with the Ruffwear. </p><p>Palisades Medium is 1.85 lb (0.84 kg) with 1068 in続 (17.5 L). The Approach Medium is 1.1 lb (0.50 kg) with 793 in続 (13 L).</p><p>The Reflector Small is 31 mL/g and $0.30 CAD/g or $9.49 CAD/L. The Banzai Small is 23 mL/g and $0.26 CAD/g or $11.42 CAD/L. </p><p>The Approach Medium is 26 mL/g and $0.24 CAD/g or $9.07/L. Palisades Medium is 20 mL/g and $0.20 CAD per g or $9.82/L.<br/><br/>The next size up from Wolf Packs is more comparable to the Ruffwear Palisades in volume with .90 lb (~408 g) and 1.2 lbs (~544 g) with 1150 in続 (18.8 L) respectfully.</p><p>Which boils down to 46 mL/g and $0.25 CAD/g or $5.36/L for the Reflector Medium. Or 35 mL/g and $0.22 CAD/g or $6.45 CAD/L for the Banzai Medium.</p><p>Was told Wolf Packs is roomier than the Ruffwear. Going to have ask the company about the sizing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Longest stretch between resupply points is 18 days at relaxed pace or 9 to 10 days at fast pace.<br/><br/>So, also going to have to calculate daily caloric requirements, the kCal per 100 gram and the volumes of kibbles.<br/><br/>Before trying to figure out what size pack I need.<br/><br/>But I don&rsquo;t want to do that right now.</p>
