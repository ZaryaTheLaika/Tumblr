                    <p>Alright, started weaning Zarya off her puppy kibbles (Purina Pro Plan) yesterday and onto an adult maintenance bag (Purina ONE) for the time being then will transition onto Inukshuk 30/25 once the pallet arrives on the 10th.<br/><br/>(Only went with Purina ONE because of the size of the bag and several people pointed out ONE and Pro Plan are almost the same. Don&rsquo;t feel like splurging on another huge bag if she&rsquo;s not a big eater anyway.)</p>
