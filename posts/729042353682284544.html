                    <p>Well, an ecollar dog owner said it&rsquo;s not possible to make a dog walk backward 20 feet (6 feet) with positive reinforcement, even with treats.<br/><br/>Well, accomplished without treats and only a bumper.</p><p>Didn&rsquo;t have a place board, so we used a branch and taught her to stand, sit and lay down behind the branch if she wants me to toss the toy.<br/><br/>Not only that, but 20 meters (65 feet) and not 20 feet.<br/><br/>To be fair, we cheated a bit since we already built a solid foundation with the fetch game. Once she was taught how to be sent on a retrieve, then teaching her to walk backward was easy-peasy.</p><p>Swear people are not very creative when it comes to training dogs.</p>
