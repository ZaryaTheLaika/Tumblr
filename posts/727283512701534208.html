                    <p>Funny when dog-people accuse me of clout-chasing for caring about animal welfare.<br/><br/>Bruh, the biggest English-language channel for laikas only has 435 subscribers, and the owner of that channel is Russian.<br/><br/>Most of the other English-language videos are people from Nordic countries who are bilingually fluent. There&rsquo;s a few from Poland, Span and so on. They don&rsquo;t have a whole lot of subscribers either.<br/><br/>The biggest laika channels with between 50 thousands to half a million subscribers all post like one-hour nature videos of camping, skiing, hiking, bushcrafting, amphibianing, snowmobiling, canoeing and other outdoorsy stuff.<br/><br/>I already know the formula if I wanted to get traction on YouTube.</p><p>Take your tinfoil hats off.</p>
