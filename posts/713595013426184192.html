The communal bickering was an absolute nightmare.</p><p>Earlier last year, I was considering getting a crocodile skink (<i>Tribolonotus gracilis</i>), a colony of emerald tree skink (<i>Lamprolepis smaragdina</i>), a tegu, a Vietnamese blue beauty snake (<i>Orthriophis taeniurus callicyanous</i>) or a pair of tree monitor (<i>Hapturosaurus</i> sp.) But ultimately ended up deciding against acquiring another reptile because a lot of hobby-breeders and hobby-keepers still place industrial breeders on a pedestal and &ldquo;preservation through commercialization&rdquo; still persists as a dominant ideology.</p><p>And folks refusing to question capitalism or not understanding the exploitation of the pet trade don&rsquo;t jive well with me.<br/><br/>There is a lot of similar hostility in dog-world amongst hobby-breeders towards evidence-based medicine, nutrition, sports, training etc in dog-world. But as Kevin said, there is use in personal experience and inherited knowledge from folklore husbandry. The problem is when anecdotes clash with data. <br/><br/>Actually having that issue with dog-training right now with folks projecting their emotions onto a puppy who doesn&rsquo;t have the toolkit to communicate with humans effectively. And people don&rsquo;t like it when you tell them to back off the dog.<br/><br/>With the last dog, rearing him was easier while living with someone who understand the science behind dog-training.<br/><br/>So, that&rsquo;s why I thought the podcast episode was worth sharing.</p><p>Other important papers of note from this fellow:</p><ul><li>Arbuckle, Kevin. &ldquo;<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin-Arbuckle/publication/262116409_Influence_of_diet_on_mineral_composition_of_crickets_used_as_prey_for_captive_amphibians_specifically_Hylidae/links/0c960536b5471d7c33000000/Influence-of-diet-on-mineral-composition-of-crickets-used-as-prey-for-captive-amphibians-specifically-Hylidae.pdf">Influence of diet on mineral composition of crickets used as prey for captive amphibians, specifically Hylidae&rdquo;</a> [PDF, 628 kb]. <i>Master of Science), University of Glasgow</i> (2009). <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin-Arbuckle/publication/262116409_Influence_of_diet_on_mineral_composition_of_crickets_used_as_prey_for_captive_amphibians_specifically_Hylidae/links/0c960536b5471d7c33000000/Influence-of-diet-on-mineral-composition-of-crickets-used-as-prey-for-captive-amphibians-specifically-Hylidae.pdf">Archived</a> from the original on March 25, 2021.</li><li>Arbuckle, Kevin. &ldquo;<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin-Arbuckle/publication/45183745_Suitability_of_day-old_chicks_as_food_for_captive_snakes/links/59dfcceb0f7e9bc51256c4d1/Suitability-of-day-old-chicks-as-food-for-captive-snakes.pdf">Suitability of day‐old chicks as food for captive snakes</a>&rdquo; [PDF, 344 kb]. <i>Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition</i> 94, no. 6 (2010): e296-e307.
