                    <h1>Zarya made a cameo in a kibble review</h1><p>A number of Dr. Amber Rea&rsquo;s own subscribers asked her to review the <a href="https://www.inukshukpro.com/inukshuk-2616">Inukshuk 26/16</a>. But I already have had a bag of 30/25, so sent her some footage and photographs.<br/><br/>Her videos are not so much product reviews but teaching people how to evaluate pet foods on their own while they are out shopping since marketers focus on buzzwords and play games with the ingredient panels instead of highlighting the quality of nutrition.</p><figure class="tmblr-full tmblr-embed" data-provider="youtube" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9Ar_u8Ols" data-orig-width="356" data-orig-height="200"><iframe width="356" height="200" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_J9Ar_u8Ols?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Best Performance Diet?: Inukshuk dog food review"></iframe></figure><p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things:</p><p>It&rsquo;s fair to critique a brand for excess minerals.

There are separate <a href="https://www.inukshukpro.com/extended-feeding-guides">feeding charts for puppies, seniors and inactive dogs</a>. Given many dogs protest if given less kibbles, it&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to follow the recommendations from the extended charts.</p><p>To be honest, the reseller advised us to to feed 26/16; but then we informed Zarya was a fussy-eater. The plan was to start with 30/25, and if she becomes chunky, switch to the 26/16.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s also still fair to evaluate a mushing-specific brand for the general population since working dogs have resting periods regardless.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not really the point of the video. Dr. Rea was only wanted to inform there is a section in the <a href="https://www.markmorrisinstitute.org/sacn5_download.html"><i>Small Animal Clinical Nutrition</i></a> textbook for <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mmi_sacn5/2019/SACN5_18.pdf">working dogs</a> [PDF, 6.8 MB, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230521154201/https://s3.amazonaws.com/mmi_sacn5/2019/SACN5_18.pdf">archived</a>]. She emphasizes one should consult with their own veterinarian rather than relying on advice from the Internet.</p><p>Did propose to send a discarded bag of the Purina Pro Plan Puppy food in the mail since I liked her video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJ1sIBFRw0">comparing Purina Pro Plan versus Purina ONE</a> [video, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230721231106/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJ1sIBFRw0">archived</a>]; but then later found out Dr. Amber Rea <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urxl_5mghqo">discontinued the concept</a> [video]. And while Amber did say the packaging not necessary, there was still some residual cultural guilt <a href="https://youtu.be/tYSHUWcAnoU?t=443">about not keeping promises</a> [video, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230330000506/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYSHUWcAnoU">archived</a>] since a person is judged based on whether or not they keep their words.
