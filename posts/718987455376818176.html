                    <p>Always weird when a YouTuber knows enough about editing to cut similar to a film-esque documentary, but then have random inserted shots of sped up time lapses.<br/><br/>Like, if you know the film language enough to fool the viewer into thinking you&rsquo;re a decent editor, then you would know how to cut without using time lapses (outside context of astrovideography / astrophography, indicating seasonal changes, documenting plant growth etc).</p>
