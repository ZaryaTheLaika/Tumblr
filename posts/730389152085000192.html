Even the so-called &ldquo;raw&rdquo; meatloaves made with flour as a binder they sell in those pre-packaged logs doesn&rsquo;t do it for her.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s good that her play-drive is higher than her food-drive, but rather have something safer for immunocompromised friends and family members as a last-ditch option.<br/><br/>Going to have experiment with dog-porridge recipes until I found something which will work with her.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, the fake &ldquo;raw&rdquo; meatloaf lost its value.<br/><br/>Zarya is unable to differentiate someone who is angry versus someone who is experiencing chronic pain. So, when that person was in proximity of the meatloaf, Zarya just noped out.</p>
