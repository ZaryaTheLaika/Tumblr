                    <p>Not really a fan of people romanticizing <a href="https://href.li/?https://rop.org/uia/">rural America</a>. Especially since a lot of U.Sians haven&rsquo;t yet reckoned with long-lasting <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1gcipAvplY&amp;pp=ygUVYmFkZW1wYW5hZGEgamVmZmVyc29u">effect of Jefferson&rsquo;s ideology</a>.<br/><br/>(Likewise for Canada as well.)<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s a lot of <a href="https://href.li/?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_conservatism_in_Germany">VÃ¶lkisch</a> and <a href="https://href.li/?https://greenantifascist.org/">ecofascist</a> stuff in that space when decoupled from decolonialism and critiques of settler entitlements. Many fascists advocate for a return to 1930s agrarianism when they push for localism and they often blame the Global South for climate changes.<br/><br/>(Would post a few stills from a propaganda film for demonstration, but don&rsquo;t really want people supporting the translators if they end up agreeing with the fascist messaging.)<br/><br/>And this is from someone who support Indigenous self-determination and <a href="https://href.li/?https://redpaper.yellowheadinstitute.org/">landback</a> in regard to subsistence pastoralism (eg. steppe peoples the reindeer herders, Indigenous groups <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/chilcotin-wild-horses-documentary-series-history-1.5443946">protecting wild horses</a> in U.S. and Canada and so on).</p>
