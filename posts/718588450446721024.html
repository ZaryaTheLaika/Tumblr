                    <p>Too bad none of the retrieving clubs here in Canada (or the U.S. for that matter) recognize West Siberian Laikas.<br/><br/>Laikas can participate in retrieving field trials in Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and a few other places.<br/><br/>The JGV-USA still hasn&rsquo;t returned any of the emails or letters. The parent organization in Germany allows laikas to participate since the &lsquo;50s in East Germany and since the '90s in the reunified Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p><p>Would be really easy to put a title on her.</p><p>Zarya enjoys doing drills, and she will still work even while heat-exhausted. She had to be told to drink water or take a breather.</p>
