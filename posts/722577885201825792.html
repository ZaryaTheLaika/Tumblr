hunting purposes, for instance, in wolf hunting. The fast Taygan (another indigenous dog breed)
chased the wolves, while the strong Kadarchy Yt corralled the wolves (Darzha 2013). Until now,
the Kadarchy Yt was known as a steppe herding-hunting dog, but this research suggests that people
in the taiga belt also used these dogs for only hunting purposes. According to Sikachinskiy (1971),
150
the Kadarchy Yt usually served as a ruthless hunter that pursued either sable or bear in the taiga
districts. Petri (1928) states that the Karagas (the Tofa), also valued the Buryat-Mongolian
shepherd dogs. They bought or exchanged them from the Buryats and used them for hunting.
During my fieldwork in 2014 in Tozhu, many people recognized the Kadarchy Yt when I showed
a picture. Although this district was comparatively isolated in the past, these dogs were popular in
the villages. It is hardly surprising that they were used for hunting. An elder, Sergey Kyrganay,
told me that some herder-hunters also kept the Kadarchy Yt. According to Sergey, he was the last
herder-hunter to keep a Kadarchy Yt in the early 1980s. Sergey could not remember his dog's
name, but he remembered well that he was a fearless hunter. His dog was large and aggressive and
hunted only big-game animals. Sergey stressed that the Kadarchy Yt is better than the Laika breed
in terms ofbeing more aggressive than the Laika and not afraid of a wolf or a bear. Some ofthe
Laika, lacking aggressiveness, are afraid to attack predators. One informant, Ayanmaa Damba
from Adyr-Kezhig, told me that her father worked as a ranger in Adyr-Kezhig taiga. His Russian
friends gave him a present, a Kadarchy Yt puppy, in 1985. He went hunting with him, but the dog
was lost after three years in the taiga" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d4e738bf3a391f8f57339f93fb80a9b2/468e3d1b3ec0e6e9-ff/s75x75_c1/ac07ad04229353e47307ee2db92c3edb93704167.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d4e738bf3a391f8f57339f93fb80a9b2/468e3d1b3ec0e6e9-ff/s100x200/ce7ee16e5a88510ada514a6482b9be6f439d7f8a.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d4e738bf3a391f8f57339f93fb80a9b2/468e3d1b3ec0e6e9-ff/s250x400/be50190402533c902408b6fdb52b4b698d6ea77f.jpg 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d4e738bf3a391f8f57339f93fb80a9b2/468e3d1b3ec0e6e9-ff/s400x600/06cee744317b30774300e273a00f983cab3d8de5.jpg 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d4e738bf3a391f8f57339f93fb80a9b2/468e3d1b3ec0e6e9-ff/s500x750/1d8b683dfc05c6dd53d8fe0b65800c3c55d46b69.jpg 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d4e738bf3a391f8f57339f93fb80a9b2/468e3d1b3ec0e6e9-ff/s540x810/08ff4c1d369c2b377f1f64aaed7f4d5b1c8d9b62.jpg 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d4e738bf3a391f8f57339f93fb80a9b2/468e3d1b3ec0e6e9-ff/s640x960/1f11f27a288a92aa6c75af9b34c27f75d326f79f.jpg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px"><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure></div><p><b>â€”</b> Arakchaa, Tayana. &ldquo;<a href="https://href.li/?http://hdl.handle.net/11122/10268">Reindeer, dogs, and horses among the Tozhu<br/>reindeer herder-hunters in the Siberian ta</a>iga&rdquo; [PDF, 16.51 MB]. <i>University of Alaska Fairbanks</i> (December 2018): 150 - 151.
