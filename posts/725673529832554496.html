                    <p>Dear random homeowner,<br/><br/>I know you don&rsquo;t like dogs on your property. Most people don&rsquo;t like strange dogs on their property. No one likes dealing with grass burns or zoonotic diseases. Every dog parent / custodian / guardian / owner knows that.<br/><br/>The whole neighbourhood is full of home owners and house renters, so they know about lawncare. You&rsquo;re not dealing with some apartment renters or condo owners who don&rsquo;t know what house maintenance is like. Everyone has a backyard.<br/><br/>But if you are tired of random dog walkers standing idly in front of your house regularly, maybe ask your neighbours to keep their cats indoors, in the yard or leash them? That&rsquo;s the reason why everyone keeps lining up in front of your house.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;ve never stood in front of your house until today, but I know why other people stopped in front of your house.<br/><br/>Your area has three free-roaming cats which bolts under trucks. They are not feral cats. We know which house they belong to.<br/><br/>I know individual dog owners are responsible for controlling their dogs, but the city bylaws also say cats are not supposed to roam and the law acknowledges the responsibility is on the dog handlers, not the dogs, if the dogs are on people&rsquo;s lawns.</p><p>If you are going to try and enforce the rules, don&rsquo;t do it selectively and enforce those rules on your neighbours as well. Because your neighbours hasn&rsquo;t been following the bylaws for several years now long before pandemic pups became an issue.</p>
