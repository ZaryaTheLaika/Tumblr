                    <p>Well, the herding egg toy is out of commission. There are teeth marks on it. Can sand down the rough edges to give some longevity, but the egg is over twelve or thirteen years old at this point and who knows what kind of UV exposure the plastic went through.<br/><br/>Problem is can&rsquo;t remember if the egg was a generic no-name brand from Petecetera or if Jolly used to sell those without the embossed logo.</p><p>Disappointed in the quality of Jolly&rsquo;s horse toys this year compared to when we originally picked up a Tug'n'Toss in 2015.</p>
