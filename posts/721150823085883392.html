Conformation is taken into account as well, but again in the context of the hound's function, looking for traits that are typical of good hunting Salukis. Temperament is important - the Saluki must be friendly to its people, obedient and cooperative. It is expected to live peacefully with other animals and livestock, yet be fiery and relentless on game, and to guard its owners property. And function, not just the hunting instinct but hunting ability, is paramount. So, the basis and goals of Saluki breeding in the COOs and the West differ as a whole, or at least the emphasis and expectations differ, making some traits more common in one population than the other, though overlaps occur." srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4ec54a51d7b5f6b857d155ff75917123/48de8f0996231c47-24/s75x75_c1/0e7499e6dfa7a8a1e6cc9f020043593ed29ae6a0.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4ec54a51d7b5f6b857d155ff75917123/48de8f0996231c47-24/s100x200/dc5f233e7cbd991264f8b57d1136f10e8f8ac05d.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4ec54a51d7b5f6b857d155ff75917123/48de8f0996231c47-24/s250x400/58c5b9f02343c7b560f2c8bad803ade5a22c0fcc.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4ec54a51d7b5f6b857d155ff75917123/48de8f0996231c47-24/s400x600/4451c02fb9d20ae35424435dba9135850074d2bf.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4ec54a51d7b5f6b857d155ff75917123/48de8f0996231c47-24/s500x750/e5d50fbb29e9adf6b8d3307b199af9be9c027dfc.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4ec54a51d7b5f6b857d155ff75917123/48de8f0996231c47-24/s540x810/c53ebaf3b6d9da4799421fe20f5436b2f88e3644.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/4ec54a51d7b5f6b857d155ff75917123/48de8f0996231c47-24/s640x960/c079897219c12d881a63421d934cef18a8b0755e.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"/><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure></div><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="198" data-orig-width="591"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/125ce642033f0c037127e38aafd9aaff/48de8f0996231c47-a1/s640x960/92609b5eda3d4e16438e887996a5c42f29fc4200.png" data-orig-height="198" data-orig-width="591" alt="COO Salukis have the same temperamental traits as Western Salukis, but in a more concentrated form. They are more intense - passionate, loyal, fiery, loving, cooperative, smart, charismatic and endlessly energetic. COO Salukis are bred to work with their masters, and it shows - they relish close contact and doing things with their owner - it is generally more ingrained in them and can be seen especially when free running. Which does not mean that recall is necessarily 100% whenever the owner wishes, certainly not when game is sighted!" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/125ce642033f0c037127e38aafd9aaff/48de8f0996231c47-a1/s75x75_c1/104387f61e0ff7491cb4333f4db14923bbfe48a3.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/125ce642033f0c037127e38aafd9aaff/48de8f0996231c47-a1/s100x200/4556bcf137243738ca23caa0726f9643bf2ad3df.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/125ce642033f0c037127e38aafd9aaff/48de8f0996231c47-a1/s250x400/0134ae4bdf4874e8623d6ace497f6dd36d577dfb.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/125ce642033f0c037127e38aafd9aaff/48de8f0996231c47-a1/s400x600/c56ef50bd25ea5e74613fc96e85d48e46d9b44e8.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/125ce642033f0c037127e38aafd9aaff/48de8f0996231c47-a1/s500x750/12399e86b20adbf15ba5ea4fb174932b2d440eb7.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/125ce642033f0c037127e38aafd9aaff/48de8f0996231c47-a1/s540x810/ac13ce924cb9d61c65e55064d4f4555986a93db0.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/125ce642033f0c037127e38aafd9aaff/48de8f0996231c47-a1/s640x960/92609b5eda3d4e16438e887996a5c42f29fc4200.png 591w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px"/><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure></div><p>Yeah.<br/><br/>My next laika is going to be imported from East Siberia or the Far East.<br/><br/>I really like Pavel.
