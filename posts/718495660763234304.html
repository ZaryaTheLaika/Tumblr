                    <p>Judging from the hang time Zarya is giving while retrieving her favourite soccer ball, she might become a decent frisbee dog.<br/><br/>Her hind legs are not as powerful as Pavel&rsquo;s, the kangaroo laika, but damn, she has a high clearance.<br/><br/>Pavel will retrieve as well, but he only does it because of the trust system and mutual relationship, which would otherwise be easily broken in the wrong hands. He likes working with his partner, but is very picky about who he wants to work with.<br/><br/>Pavel will retrieve game birds for his new partner. Won&rsquo;t post pictures because Tumblr doesn&rsquo;t have a way to blur photos like Twitter or Mastodon.<br/><br/>Zarya retrieves because she lives for the retrieve.<br/><br/>Laikas are not supposed to be frisbee dogs, and there are highly specialized retrieving lines from Moscow.<br/><br/>Although the original Indigenous population will retrieve because Mansi and Khanty peoples hunt waterfowls; but the arrangements are more like &ldquo;oh, you need a moose dog? I have two, want mine? I only need to feed one. Do you have a marten dog to give in exchange for the moose dog? I am in need of one&rdquo; rather than any kind of systematic breeding.<br/><br/>At the risk of going off-topic, there is a guy local to me claiming to have retrieving lines imported from Ukraine.</p>
