This is primarily the Mansi (Vogul) Laika and Hanty (Ostyak) Laika, Komi (Zyryan) Laika, Uralian
Laika, Udmurt Laika, Evenk (Lamut) Laika and Nenets Laika. It also included sled Laikas of the NE
part of Russia, (Shurupow, 1993).
The East Siberian Laika is a younger, still not stabilized purebred, but just like our other purebred
Laikas, it cannot be considered as a certain aboriginal dog. A conventional idea is that its standard is
based on the description of the Amur Laika by I. I. Vakhru[ev (1945).
To the contrary of the introduction to the standard, it is not based on Evenk’s Laika. The standard
of the East Siberian Laika, as well as the standards of our other purebred Laikas, is based on the
seemingly consistent expectation that our Laikas should be increasing in size and better coated in the
direction from west to east, according to E. I. Shereshevsky. However, peoples of our north, Siberia and
Far East did not know about this consistent array of breeds. Everywhere, and also in the Far East, they
had different dogs, some of which were rather small. The standard of the East Siberian Laika and
subsequently dog shows favored the biggest and sturdiest, coarse built dogs. This had its impact on
their hunting quality. Thus, I was evaluating the work of dogs at hunting contests of Laikas from the
Urals, Siberia and the Far East. Big, impressive and rather phlegmatic East Siberian Laika males had the
worst results, and smaller lean dogs were the best.

I.
Shereshevsky. In 1949, temporary standards of
Karelo-Finnish Laika, Russo-European Laika, West
Siberian Laika and East Siberian Laika were accepted.
Each of these breeds was supposedly a result of
merging of several local type Laikas. Actually, this
was not true. The desirable was presented as if it were
real. For example, the Russo-European Laika was
developed by deliberate breeding. One of the founder
males of this breed named Pootik 65l, was obtained
from mating of Zyryan type male named Muzgar with
West Siberian female named Pityukh-II. At a later
time, the blood of West Siberian Laikas with desirable
phenotypes was repeatedly added to the breed. In
Sverdlovsk region, Hanty and Mansi Laikas were used
for the creation of the West Siberian Laika, but in the
Moscow Laika breeding region, besides Hanty and
Mansi Laikas, Laikas of Zyryan, Votyak, Cheremis
and some other Laikas also had their influence.
Merging of East Siberian Laikas is still not completed.
In 1952, Cynological Soviet of Glavokhota of
Russian Federation has approved permanent standards
for Karelo-Finnish, Russo-European and West
Siberian Laikas. I will not discuss in detail the history
of development of modern purebred Laika breeds,
because it had been well done in publications by A. T.
Voilochnikov and S. D. Voilochnikov, G. Z. Nasyrov
and many others. I am nostalgic about lost aboriginal
type Laikas. For example, in the small country of
To preserve through education...........
Japan there are more Laika breeds then in Russia.
This raises a few questions. Why geographical
principle and not ethnographical one, as it had been
done earlier, was chosen for division of Laika breeds?
Why so few Laika breeds had been distinguished?
Why cynological and scientific establishment did not
resist this? In my opinion this happened by political
ideological reasons. “Father of all peoples and genius
in all sciences” I. V. Stalin declared that very soon, in
USSR, there will be no ethnic nations. There will be
only one ethnicity: the “Soviet People”. Everything
associated with national consciousness had been
suppressed at all levels. Sometimes this reached the
level of outright absurdity. In Maritime Territory it
was not allowed to name a Korean as Korean or a
Nanai as Nanai. Instead they should be named
“comrade easterner”. One, who would not comply,
was risking getting real jail time for “small bourgeois
chauvinism.” Forget the ethnographic principle for
naming Laika breeds. The Party and the Government
required creating one breed of hunting dogs of
peasants and workers and some breeds were declared
bourgeois luxury and vestiges of feudalism. This was
OK, if they agreed upon four Laika breeds. During
those years, in science, “lysenkoism” ruled. Genetics
was declared a “whore of imperialism” and any
independent thinking was prosecuted by hostile
measures. Everybody remembered the fate of N. I.
Vavilov.

criminal. This was not a big deal being a senior
science worker like E. I Shereshevsky was, but his
system of classification of breeds had been accepted,
despite the availability of professors and academic
level scientists, who knew the essence of the problem.
It was dangerous to deviate from the “general party
line” of the time. However, in the beginning, many
dog breeders and hunters resisted this classification,
but, unfortunately, nobody listened to them. Anyway,
we lost the aboriginal Laika breeds in their original
state. This is a pity, of course, but history cannot be
reversed. Now, in Russia, there are four purebred
hunting Laikas, carrying genetics of aboriginal Laikas
of the past.
