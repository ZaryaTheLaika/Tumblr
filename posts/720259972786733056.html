                    <p>Recall/check in fail this morning.<br/><br/>For some reason instead of using her senses to find me when she checks in, she goes to where she last saw me then alerted her to where I am.<br/><br/>But then one time she disappeared for a good 20 minutes with no visual of her being in proximity. Found her waiting in the parking lot by the truck.<br/><br/>Strange. Used to previous dogs being able to find me and checking in every five to fifteen minutes instead of them going back to the spot where they last saw me.</p>
