Even so, it is often necessary en route to add to the supply of food by hunting
or fishing, and a small nylon fish-net or casting rod can usually be used to
advantage on a long trip. The former is preferable for Arctic char and the
latter for lake trout. Hunting by whites is strictly controlled in the Northwest Territories, and, when travelling without Eskimos, this may make the
supply of dog food a problem and so limit the usefulness of pack dogs. Also,
if only a few dogs are used, it is clearly wasteful to kill large game such as
bear and caribou, as only a small amount of meat can be carried. However,
if birds and mammals are being collected for scientific purposes, the carcasses
make a useful food supplement. Parry's Ground Squirrel, which is abundant on
parts of the mainland, is easy to secure and makes very acceptable dog feed.
Some dogs, but not all, will allow themselves to get into quite poor condition
before they will eat duck, or, in fact, most birds except geese and ptarmigan.
When lemmings are abundant a dog will sometimes snatch up enough on the
march to nourish him at least partially." srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/386f88eddc2e513dbe58d550fd413f6f/5b7481749ad83745-84/s75x75_c1/27ce874d1e7475f8af106dded7f4cddac181c527.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/386f88eddc2e513dbe58d550fd413f6f/5b7481749ad83745-84/s100x200/5e73ce21df1aff48f808083db6a992a0a179bf7e.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/386f88eddc2e513dbe58d550fd413f6f/5b7481749ad83745-84/s250x400/9e5285f88ef5b19c6f4504dd010fdb795e246d6d.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/386f88eddc2e513dbe58d550fd413f6f/5b7481749ad83745-84/s400x600/7d0a6ce6a684b94b5389b8b887860e959ce0f497.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/386f88eddc2e513dbe58d550fd413f6f/5b7481749ad83745-84/s500x750/fe0676aa437db45f1774ffc60dd28247631ce769.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/386f88eddc2e513dbe58d550fd413f6f/5b7481749ad83745-84/s540x810/fdef90ce6e3e8abf225176468a01f37d62a2c282.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/386f88eddc2e513dbe58d550fd413f6f/5b7481749ad83745-84/s640x960/e704267e89fed61a985373fdb99cafeaee30bd7a.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/386f88eddc2e513dbe58d550fd413f6f/5b7481749ad83745-84/s1280x1920/97468fcdb22fc4f46595b26a6def809d091051f8.png 1235w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px"><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure></div><p><b>—</b> MacPherson, A.

unexpected meetings with a white trapper from the upper Anderson River,
a geographical survey party, and a temporary R.C.A.F. detachment, followed. Certain disadvantages attendant on working alone in a wilderness
area became very apparent. Much time was spent hunting and fishing in
order to feed myself and the Eskimo dog that I had brought with me from
Tuktoyaktuk as companion and pack dog. Travelling and collecting as
many birds and small mammals as possible made up part of my programme.
These demands on my time had the result that observations on bird behaviour were often incidental rather than systematic. Nevertheless, for
some species the observations reported below add new facts or corroborate
the somewhat meagre data available in the literature." srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/888508fd2ae9fbed64855947190567c5/5b7481749ad83745-fd/s75x75_c1/d667bd31b4d9b76f1948b31002455ca756a0075e.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/888508fd2ae9fbed64855947190567c5/5b7481749ad83745-fd/s100x200/4160f1c9cf240e320e7ff2dbe5747da40ff27762.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/888508fd2ae9fbed64855947190567c5/5b7481749ad83745-fd/s250x400/cc0df1541701cda7e3748241d0322e8e018e80c0.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/888508fd2ae9fbed64855947190567c5/5b7481749ad83745-fd/s400x600/3284aa3692aedcdfc77088c10f3af933e8b4a0e3.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/888508fd2ae9fbed64855947190567c5/5b7481749ad83745-fd/s500x750/6da262bd4773cd92dd60fc537cd3856d6324d4be.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/888508fd2ae9fbed64855947190567c5/5b7481749ad83745-fd/s540x810/3b2d31c484bbd04e32f3fa4367f33ef8ef7e0b2d.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/888508fd2ae9fbed64855947190567c5/5b7481749ad83745-fd/s640x960/f9fd265b5b66df4f3dbd55fd358802a002e091b9.png 593w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure></div><p><b>—</b> Hohn, E.
