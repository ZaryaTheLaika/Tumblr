                    <p>Please use your brains. </p><p>Chickens are not safe around laikas because they tree grouses? Are you serious? Does that means chickens around Pointers and Golden Retrievers are not safe because they also flush grouses?</p><p>Use your head (emphasizing twice). Please. Chickens also co-exist with barking bird-dogs on farms in Nordic countries and in Russia as well.<br/><br/>Besides, in Russia, you&rsquo;re more likely to see free-roaming chickens in the village than in the U.S.</p><p>The nonsense about chickens being unsafe around chickens because of grouse-hunting is almost as silly as the Norrbottenspets person who claimed it&rsquo;s illegal to hunt with spitzes in Canada because of cattle when reindeer-herders also have the same problem with hunters from southern Finland <a href="https://yle.fi/a/3-12606796">refusing to train their moose-dogs</a> whereas the locals train their own moose-dogs to leave the reindeer alone.</p><p>Just owe up to <a href="https://www.shelmapackkennel.com/content/small-farm-protectors/">your responsibility</a> as the dog&rsquo;s caretaker or as the handler instead of blaming the breed or speculating about the country-of-origin.<br/><br/>Gosh, have some commonsense.</p>
