                    <p>English-speaking YouTube dog-trainers sure have an interesting reaction to finding out Finland and Sweden prohibits confining dogs in small crates at home for extended periods.<br/><br/>No, crates are not banned. The crates can still be used at conformation shows, at events, for veterinary care and aftercare, during transportation, for hunting trips etc. In fact, it&rsquo;s kind of mandatory to crate a dog in the car.<br/><br/>Most people just leave the crate door open at home. Like a dog bed. If they have a crate as part of the furnitures.</p><p>And no, it is not required to remove the door.</p><p>It&rsquo;s more common to confine a dog to a room. But that room need to be sufficiently big enough. You can&rsquo;t just lock up a dog in the bathroom or in a closet.</p><p>And the law is selectively enforced anyway. Usually neighbours report such incidents. But, it&rsquo;s like, if people notice that you have a dog but don&rsquo;t take them outside for walks, then they start getting suspicious.</p><p>Besides, containment isn&rsquo;t illegal. Confined dogs have a minimum space requirement. But usually most people instead use baby-gates, playpens, kennel runs or a tie-out or a zipline (aka cable trolley) for managing their dogs.<br/><br/>While the information isn&rsquo;t always <a href="https://href.li/?https://web.archive.org/web/20210810061115/https://www.lansstyrelsen.se/download/18.10adba9e1616f8edbc975a/1526068739055/Animal-welfare-regulations-dog.pdf">available in English</a>, there are enough <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8495059/">second-hand references</a> in English to figure out what laws are being referred to and to simply use a machine translator once the <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2010/20100674">original source</a> [also <a href="https://href.li/?https://jordbruksverket.se/djur/hundar-katter-och-smadjur/hundar/sa-skoter-du-din-hund">here</a>] is found.<br/><br/>Or just check <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/theotherendoftheleash/dog-laws-around-the-world#comment-277120">the comments</a> under blogs and videos. Usually people will share what is allowed and isn&rsquo;t allowed since most are bilingually fluent.<br/><br/>Also, like, Sweden and Finland aren&rsquo;t the only countries where crating is either uncommon or unheard of. If one use Google, they will find <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/25/dogs-crating-pet-abuse">other countries</a> where the practice isn&rsquo;t as widely prevalent as it is in the U.S. and Canada. And only became known after Cesar Millan&rsquo;s books were <a href="https://href.li/?https://doi.org/10.1163/15685306-12341342">translated from English</a> into other languages.<br/><br/>Gosh, wish dog-influencers actually look things up before making assumptions in their videos.</p>
