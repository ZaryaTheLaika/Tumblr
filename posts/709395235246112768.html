<p>Sighs. Tumblr just stripped the page of the markups again.</p><p>At least this time, at least the editor didn&rsquo;t refresh. The document is backed up offline on the computer.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> Okay, for some reason suddenly works again. No explanation whatsoever.<br/><br/>Doesn&rsquo;t have all the original outlinks from the February 5, but there is an <a href="https://href.li/?https://web.archive.org/web/20230216233754/https://zaryathelaika.tumblr.com/resources">updated copy</a> for February 16, 2023. <br/><br/>Refer to the earlier copy from February 5 for some of the broken links.<br/><br/>Also interesting Tumblr still doesn&rsquo;t recognize some of the newer tags which rendered the old ones obsolete while trying to troubleshoot. </p>
