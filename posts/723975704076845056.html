                    <p>If you want to point out the harmful effects of the &ldquo;horses are bourgeois&rdquo; rhetoric, you know there are events of forced sedentism, right?<br/><br/>And it happened everywhere from Europe to Asia, Africa and the Americas.<br/><br/>And when it comes to horses in particular, denomadization happened to Mongolians, Kyrgyzes and Kazakhs. <br/><br/>(If we&rsquo;re including reindeer, then there&rsquo;s Khanty, Mansi, Nenets, Evenks, Evens, Sakha etc)</p><p>Communists and party bureaucrats who spoke out against the damaging effects of sedentarizationÂ were ignored, silenced, disciplined or purged. Some were saying Kazakh economy was already communist so there was no need to implement such policies.</p>
