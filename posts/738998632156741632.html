In large part because the lands are fragmented and one requires permissions to cross locked off parcels of land. Especially with absentee landlords sitting in big cities (eg. New York City, Toronto) and notorious for not answering emails or phone calls. And becoming more difficult every year.</p><p>Trying to tie farm-dogs into labour politics of farmhands is nonsensical here. </p><p>If you really want to critique agricultural animals being commodified by capitalism, could at least brush up a bit on David Nibert or read any of the eco-Marxist, green anarchist and social ecologist critiques of consumerist animal liberation groups being incomplete in their analyses of animal exploitations. </p><p>Better yet bring up how the enclosure of the commons and industrialization of livestock created the modern Border Collie, at the detriment of tenant farmers (eg. the crofters) and the British landrace collies (eg. Welsh collie, Old-Time Scotch Collie, Patagonian Sheepdog) and abroad (in the case of the Swedish Vallhunds and other herding breeds after WW2); or the development of gundogs, leisure class and the landed gentry. </p><p>Or even touch on settler-colonialism, displacements of Indigenous people (and Indigenous dogs), loss of knowledge in land stewardships, as well as the effects of cattle and sheep on prairie ecosystems. Or even just the landlordism aspect of big agriculture or the petite bourgeois politics of the small landowners.</p><p>Sorry, even working dogs are losing their jobs. There are just so much better anti-capitalist critiques of animal exploitation, landownership, industrial agriculture and privatization of farming operations.</p>
