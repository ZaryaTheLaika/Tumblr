He likes working with his partner, but is very picky about who he wants to work with.<br/><br/>Pavel will retrieve game birds for his new partner. Won&rsquo;t post pictures because Tumblr doesn&rsquo;t have a way to blur photos like Twitter or Mastodon.<br/><br/>Zarya retrieves because she lives for the retrieve.<br/><br/>Laikas are not supposed to be frisbee dogs, and there are highly specialized retrieving lines from Moscow.<br/><br/>Although the original Indigenous population will retrieve because Mansi and Khanty peoples hunt waterfowls; but the arrangements are more like &ldquo;oh, you need a moose dog? I have two, want mine? I only need to feed one. Do you have a marten dog to give in exchange for the moose dog? I am in need of one&rdquo; rather than any kind of systematic breeding.<br/><br/>At the risk of going off-topic, there is a guy local to me claiming to have retrieving lines imported from Ukraine.</p></blockquote><p>Pavel, the kangaroo boy, needed rolling bars, designed to deter wild canids, to prevent escaping from his 10&rsquo; tall kennel run. <br/><br/>Had to build that kennel run because he used to clear fences so he could swim after Canada Geese.<br/><br/>And he used to go to the top bunk bed. He was an excellent crag dog. <br/><br/>That&rsquo;s why he was dubbed the kangaroo laika.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are wondering how she retrieves soccer balls: she&rsquo;s part thylacine.<br/><br/>Need to switch her over to a 2L pop bottles or however people train their dogs for retrieving Canada Goose and Snow Goose.<br/><br/>Those 3&quot; knobby bumpers are not big enough.</p>
