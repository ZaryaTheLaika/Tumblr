Lasts a long time due the high fat percentage and stores well. Can see why thru-hikers feed the <a href="https://www.inukshukpro.com/inukshuk-3232">32/32</a>. <br/><br/>Zarya is much happier on this stuff than Purina (Pro Plan Puppy, Purina ONE Beef and Brown Rice as well as the <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/zaryathelaika/730190352758292480/verdict-on-purina-one-zarya-does-not-like-the?source=share">Lamb and Rice</a>). But she much rather eat raw meat and brown rice than anything else. She keeps her weight on Inukshuk 30/25 and doesn&rsquo;t gain nor loses. So, for a fussy eater, this is good. <br/><br/>(No, I am not carrying a survival rifle to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/polar-record/article/abs/pack-dogs-in-the-canadian-arctic/6AABF9FF83C53C89424C3E6267BEB428">shoot marmot</a> to feed Zarya on the trails! That&rsquo;s silly.) <br/><br/>Not a fan of the calcium-phosphorus levels, which ideally should stay under 1.0% calcium and 0.8% phosphorus on a dry matter basis. But found out only <a href="https://www.hillspet.com.cy/en-cy/dog-food/sp-canine-science-plan-adult-performance-chicken-dry">Hill&rsquo;s</a> produces performance kibbles for working dogs with acceptable parameters and their product is only manufactured for military and police. So, can&rsquo;t really complain given there isn&rsquo;t a lot of alternatives on the market since neither <a href="https://www.purina.ca/pro-plan/dogs/dry-dog-food/sport-performance-30-20-high-protein">Purina</a> nor <a href="https://www.royalcanin.com/ae/dogs/products/retail-products/sporting-life-endurance-4800-dry">Royal Canin</a> are any better with keeping excess minerals under control. <br/><br/>But even working and sporting dogs deserve food not taxing on their kidneys. Hopefully, pet food manufacturers will address excess minerals someday. <br/><br/>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about Inukshuk is that the products are being promoted to law enforcement. And we&rsquo;re ACAB 1312 in this house. But one would be hard-pressed to find a brand which doesn&rsquo;t cater to LE or military in their promotional materials. Will have to check to see what <a href="https://redpawdogfood.com/">Redpaw</a>&rsquo;s or <a href="https://www.kobuk.no/">Kobuk</a>&rsquo;s market shares are. <br/><br/>But for the price when everything is over $100 a bag? This one is a steal. </p><p>We ordered two more bags. Might need to pick up <a href="https://www.inukshukpro.com/inukshuk-2616">26/16</a> for the summer when the heat waves become unbearable.</p>
