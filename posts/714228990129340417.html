Please check out the <a href="https://zaryathelaika.tumblr.com/resources">Resources</a> page.<br/><br/>Some of the outlinks might require a machine-translator or a good friend willing to help to understand the content.</p><p>Tried our best to mark what language the documents and videos are in, file format, file sizes and so on. Most of the links are already backed up on Internet Archive or archive.today.</p><p>Feedbacks on how to make the page more accessible or more navigable are welcomed.<br/><br/>If you appreciate the list and wish to see continuous updates, consider <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.paypal.me/bglamours">tipping</a> via PayPal.</p></blockquote><p>Tumblr decided to nuke all the outlinks and anchors on the <a href="https://zaryathelaika.tumblr.com/resources">Resources</a> page. <br/><br/>Please be patient while the links are being restored.<br/><br/>In the meantime, you can go through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230205041800/https://zaryathelaika.tumblr.com/resources">archived copy</a> dated February 5, 2023.</p></blockquote><p>Sighs. Tumblr just stripped the page of the markups again.</p><p>At least this time, at least the editor didn&rsquo;t refresh. The document is backed up offline on the computer.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> Okay, for some reason suddenly works again. No explanation whatsoever.<br/><br/>Doesn&rsquo;t have all the original outlinks from the February 5, but there is an <a href="https://href.li/?https://web.archive.org/web/20230216233754/https://zaryathelaika.tumblr.com/resources">updated copy</a> for February 16, 2023. <br/><br/>Refer to the earlier copy from February 5 for some of the broken links.<br/><br/>Also interesting Tumblr still doesn&rsquo;t recognize some of the newer tags which rendered the old ones obsolete while trying to troubleshoot. </p></blockquote><p>In the meantime, the source code for the Tumblr pages will be hosted on <a href="https://github.com/ZaryaTheLaika/Tumblr/tree/main/pages">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/ZaryaTheLaika/Tumblr/-/tree/main/pages">GitLab</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Once all the links are restored and properly formatted for Tumblr, going to convert to markdown then host the .MD files on <a href="https://href.li/?https://zaryathelaika.github.io/">GitHub</a> and GitLab (pending) as well. For redundancy.<br/><br/>Really annoying the pages on Tumblr keep breaking. <br/><br/>Trying my best to keep things contained within ecosystems without outlinking to other social media platforms.<br/><br/>Does anyone has best practices for backing up posts without breaking copyright laws of accidentally stealing other people&rsquo;s posts and photos or pictures? Not a fan of the &ldquo;export&rdquo; feature.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, got majority of the <a href="https://zaryathelaika.tumblr.com/resources">Resources</a> page up and running.<br/><br/>Had to remove &ldquo;Nutrition&rdquo;, &ldquo;Conditioning&rdquo; and &ldquo;Training&rdquo; sections to restore functionality. Will take a look at the source code to figure out what&rsquo;s going on with the markups.<br/><br/>Those removed sections should still be accessible on Wayback Machine (<a href="https://href.li/?https://web.archive.org/web/20230205041800/https://zaryathelaika.tumblr.com/resources">February 5th</a> and <a href="https://href.li/?https://web.archive.org/web/20230216233754/https://zaryathelaika.tumblr.com/resources">February 16th</a>).<br/><br/>Source code are available on <a href="https://href.li/?https://github.com/ZaryaTheLaika/Tumblr/tree/main/pages">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://href.li/?https://gitlab.com/ZaryaTheLaika/Tumblr/-/tree/main/pages">GitLab</a>.<br/><br/>Apologies for not getting the page fixed ASAP. Trying to financially support someone to the best of our abilities, and don&rsquo;t really have a lot of spare time for side-projects.<br/><br/>When we get the Resources page back up and running again, going to convert everything to markdowns then mirror to <a href="https://github.com/ZaryaTheLaika/zaryathelaika.github.io/">GitHub Pages</a> and GitLab Pages (pending).</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, there is a limit between <a href="https://ghostflowerdreams.tumblr.com/post/172971851062">100 to 250 links</a>.<br/><br/>A lot of the stuff are from defunct websites which can only be accessed through Wayback Machine or archive.today.<br/><br/>Will come up with a different solution.<br/><br/>Easiest one would just to outlink to a document or another repository, but social media tends to penalize for going off the platform.</p>
