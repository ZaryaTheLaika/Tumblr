                    <p>Think there&rsquo;s a possibility I might need to travel to a bigger city to see a specialist. Something&rsquo;s up with my body lately.<br/><br/>But I need to find a babysitter for the laika and there&rsquo;s only one or two persons I trust to be firm but not become frustrated with the dog without resorting to compliance methods or aversive tools.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s one of those high-drive breeds which has a real strong survival fight response if they feel something is unfair or unjustified, and it&rsquo;s not a very pleasant reaction. And you&rsquo;re better off trying to cooperate with the dog than to pressure them.</p>
