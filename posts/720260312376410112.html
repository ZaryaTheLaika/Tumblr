It is important to choose your direction mainly towards the wind at first so that the dog gets the scent carried by the wind.

When you see the dog you can give him a low whistle to make him pay attention to his master. At this point the hunter will change direction, moving for instance to the right, at the same time showing the direction to the dog by hand signals. You continue like this for a while, change the direction according to the terrain continuing to the right then forward and then to the left until you are back in the original direction. While doing these diversions, you should keep the dog in sight ensuring that he criss-crosses in front of the hunter. If he doesn't, or if he stays away for several minutes you can call him by whistling. When you get to a path you can do a similar kind of exercise by moving to the left side of the path, then again to the right and left until the dog gets accustomed to searching from both sides of the path as you are instructing him. You should not use paths when beginning these search instructions but only when the dog has learnt his lesson.  At a later stage moving along a path does not disturb the dog's search but helps you to move silently. If you use paths or forest roads a lot the dog will learn to use them too much instead of moving through the forest itself." srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5374ded88278fd7008cbc2e1a5dcce22/8aeda420db689712-c4/s75x75_c1/9877cbe49adff655028babadaa0f224441363aca.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5374ded88278fd7008cbc2e1a5dcce22/8aeda420db689712-c4/s100x200/6f0552839d295178f1aeb786124ae7e6040b0678.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5374ded88278fd7008cbc2e1a5dcce22/8aeda420db689712-c4/s250x400/d51084f7287add1c1cc27e74425ebb7660cf3705.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5374ded88278fd7008cbc2e1a5dcce22/8aeda420db689712-c4/s400x600/0453bc266c939e4552d1ceae5a6267b6923cb610.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5374ded88278fd7008cbc2e1a5dcce22/8aeda420db689712-c4/s500x750/9879eaa22c025ddaeb9e5b9950fc3c8f189dcd4a.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5374ded88278fd7008cbc2e1a5dcce22/8aeda420db689712-c4/s540x810/60389cd93bddc5a177a1645191e9e84256da0710.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5374ded88278fd7008cbc2e1a5dcce22/8aeda420db689712-c4/s640x960/af4f4daae87aa3a0db0b402b33a40053e7e8c036.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5374ded88278fd7008cbc2e1a5dcce22/8aeda420db689712-c4/s1280x1920/23897964b9aa66981f13fec26ce91d934e3dcc4a.png 834w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px"><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure></div><p>—<b> </b>Lahtinen, Heidi.

of finding the right direction. What kind of
“compass” and navigator are built in their heads, I do

hunters as ordinary hunters’ tales, if not my personal
35 years long experience as a commercial hunter.
Here are some examples. In the beginning of
commercial hunting season, frightened wives of
hunters came to our business office. “Oh, some
trouble happened. My husband is our hunting for the
second week, but yesterday the dogs came home
alone”. We should rent a helicopter to check in their
hunting areas about 100-150 km from the homes of
the hunters. There were cases, when real mishaps
took place during hunting, but most of the times
nothing bad happened. In the beginning of the season,
hunters still do not hunt. They distribute supplies in
log cabins scattered over the hunting area. Dogs,
seeing that they are not needed for work and left to
their own devices, took off to a long road home. All
my own Laika could and still can even at night track
any pootik (trapping line) without a mistake even if
the dog had run there only once in past seasons.

When it turns dark, I let the dog
ahead of me. The dog may deviate a little from my
hatched cuts I left on trees, but it will never miss a
single trap. This is how they work, when they were
familiarized with the trapping trail, but there are other
examples. In 1983 with a party of hunters, I was taken
by helicopter to the alpine zone of Kuznetsky Alatau
Mountain Range for harvesting medicinal plants
(maral root). I took a West Siberian Laika bitch
named Alga. She was at the beginning of estrus. I
had a male at home, but was reluctant to breed her in
August, because in such a case I would loose the
hunting season. Other hunters did not take their dogs
and, therefore, I took her alone. A week later, I would
fly back home to Novokuznetsk city to dry the
harvested maral root at the wood processing plant. I
left the dog in care of friends, but very soon she run
away from them. She first traveled to the nearest
hunting party camp at a distance about 17- 20 km;
they had a male; she mated there, but after a couple of
days, she left that place. A week later, she arrived
home. It was hard to understand how she managed to
accomplish that. The place of harvesting roots was
over 100 km from Novokuznetsk. Her daughter,
named Tayga, could run over 17 km during one night,
to feast on meat of maral deer (Cervus elaphus
sibiricus), which had been taken with her assistance.
She ran towards the meat, not on the my ski tracks,
rather she ran in straight line, right over the steep " srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e0a4bbe604010f6ca7a8147e9250465a/8aeda420db689712-38/s75x75_c1/cf972528173dbe7aad0e15d91a278db40568840c.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/e0a4bbe604010f6ca7a8147e9250465a/8aeda420db689712-38/s100x200/18ae8b7e0c3799a230f00211cb35c1647e28aa57.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/e0a4bbe604010f6ca7a8147e9250465a/8aeda420db689712-38/s250x400/593739554be9dcbda7908826fc363be5ada9e172.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/e0a4bbe604010f6ca7a8147e9250465a/8aeda420db689712-38/s400x600/b71809ddd891c71fb0ec9221b3b595b880d1740b.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/e0a4bbe604010f6ca7a8147e9250465a/8aeda420db689712-38/s500x750/df1228c8c8d0c1422bef803f47b64f72253642d4.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/e0a4bbe604010f6ca7a8147e9250465a/8aeda420db689712-38/s540x810/855cacf651046fd33944259e93d65921e18c8485.png 532w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px"><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="427" data-orig-width="539"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b27baf7017cbf6e4fad6b29fd1fa6456/8aeda420db689712-8a/s640x960/f6eaf2b02c71a28ffb890995ef5019ee4fc071e8.png" data-orig-height="427" data-orig-width="539" alt="mountain ridge, where I have never walked with her.
Her tracks line was strikingly straight; the impression
was that the dog used a compass. Now, because of my
age, sometimes I have not enough strength to walk to
the place, where my dog found a sable. With time, the
dog learns that if I did not come until dark, waiting
becomes worthless. After spending a couple of hours
barking, she returned to the log cabin, running in a
straight line. She is running not to that cabin, which
we left in the morning, but to the next one, to which
we were heading during the day. Unfortunately,
during recent years, the ability of finding direction
diminished in the Laikas of hunters, living in cities
and some dogs even can get lost. There are Laikas,
which are wandering in forest and cannot find their
way home or back to the hunter." srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b27baf7017cbf6e4fad6b29fd1fa6456/8aeda420db689712-8a/s75x75_c1/c987a9b21b1b3bbd422c5c9e6f0b516330d23154.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/b27baf7017cbf6e4fad6b29fd1fa6456/8aeda420db689712-8a/s100x200/f53e3089ccf2a388d2f8eedb958fd03166a8fcee.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/b27baf7017cbf6e4fad6b29fd1fa6456/8aeda420db689712-8a/s250x400/ffb550a07126ef08ed8c863565837d7cb7ed85fd.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/b27baf7017cbf6e4fad6b29fd1fa6456/8aeda420db689712-8a/s400x600/fb3fa657d6940f9f749b92afd67119329edcbcd8.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/b27baf7017cbf6e4fad6b29fd1fa6456/8aeda420db689712-8a/s500x750/4f31e1413cbcd0fe072021da38b323d229ecece1.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/b27baf7017cbf6e4fad6b29fd1fa6456/8aeda420db689712-8a/s540x810/543fcb260823bc66b8d4b2a813b699c66cac22f0.png 539w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px"><span class="tmblr-alt-text-helper">ALT</span></figure></div><p><b>—</b> Popov, Aleksander V. “<a href="https://href.li/?http://www.bradanderson.org/pads/Journal-of-PADS-31-English.pdf">Hunting Laika</a>” [PDF, 1.91 MB]. <i>Journal of the International Society for Preservation of Primitive Aboriginal Dogs</i> 31 (2012): 23 – 25.
