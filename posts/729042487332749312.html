Once she was taught how to be sent on a retrieve, then teaching her to walk backward was easy-peasy.</p><p>Swear people are not very creative when it comes to training dogs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Zarya doesn&rsquo;t like food. Except for brown rice and raw meat which was what she was raised on before transfer of guardianship, but I rather keep her on kibbles.<br/><br/>She&rsquo;s picky. So, most traditional treats doesn&rsquo;t work with her.<br/><br/>But good thing she likes to play tug and fetch / retrieve.</p>
