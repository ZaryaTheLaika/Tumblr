                    <p>Wish folks in the YouTube comment section stop asking for direct links. Alphabet immediately hide them or remove them.<br/><br/>The same for every other platform including Twitter, Facebook/Instagram, Tumblr etc. Any time there&rsquo;s an external link, virality is throttled or the post itself is shadow-banned. All social media silo their users and lock them into their ecosystems.<br/><br/>All I can do is give keywords and exact titles, and if you can&rsquo;t even use a search engineâ€” that&rsquo;s on you, not me.</p>
